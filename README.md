### Welcome!

This is a technical assigment. My first choice was to build the server and Markov logic in [Rust](https://github.com/hunterlester/rusty_markov) but I got lost while using the Actix framework and cut my losses by very quickly switching to Node.js.
In particular I was originally intending to spend more time focusing on multithreading in addition to asychronous IO, while touching on atomic reference counting and mutexes in order to safely operation on cache.
